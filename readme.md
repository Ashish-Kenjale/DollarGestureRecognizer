# Dollar Recognizers 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DanielCardonaRojas/DollarGestureRecognizer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DanielCardonaRojas/DollarGestureRecognizer)

Implements the family of popular dollar recognizers in swift and expose them as a set of custom UIGestureRecognizer
subclasses. That can be easily included in iOS projects.

For a detailed discription on how all this works refer to the [papers](http://depts.washington.edu/madlab/proj/dollar/ndollar.html)


## Features

- Load templates from bezier paths.
- UIGestureRecognizer implementations for each recognizer in the dollar recognizer algorith family.

## TODOS

- Implement the protractor optimization for the $1 recognizer.
- Implement the $N recognizer
- Implement the $P recognizer
- Make carthage compatible
